fontaxes - Additional font axes for LaTeX
=========================================

The fontaxes package adds several new font axes on top of LaTeX's New Font
Selection Scheme. In particular, it splits the shape axis into a primary and
a secondary shape axis, and it adds three new axes to deal with the different
figure versions offered by many professional fonts.

The development of this font package is hosted at
[GitHub](https://github.com/ummels/fontaxes).
