fontaxes - Additional font axes for LaTeX
=========================================

The fontaxes package adds several new font axes on top of the New Font
Selection Scheme (NFSS). In particular, it splits the shape axis into
a primary and a secondary shape axis, and it adds three new axes to
deal with the different figure versions, offered by many professional fonts.

Usage
-----

To use this package, include

    \usepackage{fontaxes}

in the preamble of your LaTeX document. See the PDF documentation for details.

Installation
------------

To install the package and its documentation in your home texmf tree, run:

    make install

If you want to use a different texmf tree, you can specify it using the
variable TEXMFDIR:

    make install TEXMFDIR=/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

Afterwards, you may need to regenerate the file database:

    texhash
